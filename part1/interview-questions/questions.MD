# Interview Questions

### 1. Social network connectivity

Given a social network containing $n$ members and a log file containing $m$ timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be $m$ $log$ $n$ or better and use extra space proportional to $n$.

    <ol>
    <li>hello</li>
    <li>hello</li>
    </ol>

### 2. Union-find with specific canonical element.

For example, if one of the connected components is $\{1, 2, 6, 9\}$, then the $find()$ method should return $9$ for each of the four elements in the connected components.

    Maintain an extra array to the weighted quick-union data structure that stores for each root i the large element in the connected component containing i.

### 3. Successor with delete.

Given a set of n integers $S=\{0,1,...,n−1\}$ and a sequence of requests of the following form:

- Remove $x$ from $S$.
- Find the successor of $x$: the smallest $y$ in $S$ such that $y≥x$.

Design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.

    Use the modification of the union−find data discussed in the previous question.
